# End-to-End Named Entity Recognition (NER) with BERT Transformed learning on GCP (Docker & CircleCI)

This repository implements a complete Named Entity Recognition (NER) pipeline using a pre-trained Hugging Face Transformers model (BERT). It enables to identify and classify named entities (e.g. people, organizations, locations) within text data. The pipeline leverages the power of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for deployment and scalability, containerized with Docker for portability, and streamlined with CircleCI for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).

# Features

- Leverages pre-trained BERT model from Hugging Face Transformers for efficient and accurate NER.
- Provides a user-friendly interface to process text data and extract named entities.
- Scales seamlessly on GCP for handling large text datasets.
- Encapsulated in Docker containers for easy deployment across various environments.
- Automated CI/CD pipeline through CircleCI for streamlined development and deployment.
